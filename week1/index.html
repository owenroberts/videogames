			<h1>Video Game Genres</h1>
			<p><a href="/">Video Games</a> > Week 1 > Genre</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<blockquote>Genre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature. Poetry, prose, and performance each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story.
			<br>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre" target="blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre</a></blockquote>
			<p>Genre is a starting point for talking about different categories in art that share similar traits such as style and theme.  It is always changing and endlessly debatable, but it's a useful shorthand for describing the basic characterisitcs of a work of art.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at the differences in genre classification between video games and "traditional" mediums like literature, art and film.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Literature</h2>
			<p>Forms: prose, poetry</p>
			<p>Basic genres: epic, tragedy, comedy</p>
			<p>Sub-genres of fiction: drama, fables, fantasy, fiction (novels and short stories), folklore, historical fiction, horror, humor, mystery, mythology, poetry (verse), realism, science fiction</p>
			<p>Sub-genre of non-fiction: autobiography, biography, essay, narrative nonfiction, nonfiction, speech</p> 
			<p>Literary genres are based first on the style of writing (prose vs poetry) and then on subject matter or plot elements.</p>
			<p>Literary genres are also based on the historical period of specific works of literature.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Film</h2>
			<p>Genres: action, adventure, comedy, crime/gangster, drama, epics, historical, horror, musical, dance, science fiction, war, westerns</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.filmsite.org/genres.html" target="blank">Main Film Genres</a></p>
			<p>Film genres reflect setting, theme and plots.</p>
			<p>Most films fit into at least one and often more than one of these genres.  Film categorization is also done using the Auteur System, or films by a particular director or influenced by their style, such as Hitchcock films.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Art</h2>
			<p>Art is categorized by mediums and historical movements.</p>
			<p>Mediums: drawings, painting, printmaking, sculpture, collage, textile, photgraphy, film, video, performance, multimedia</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_periods" target="blank">Art periods</a></p>
			<p>Renaissance genres: history painting, portrait, genre (scenes of everyday life), landscape, animal, still life</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Video games</h2>
			<blockquote>
				Video game genres are determined by gameplay: what challenges face the player and what actions he takes to overcome those challenges. So we clearly have sports games, shooter games, racing games, and so on.

			<p>Main genres: action, adventure, role-playing, simulation, strategy, casual, massively multiplayer online</p>

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature
	In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.

			<h2>Roguelike</h2>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike" target="blank">Roguelike</a> games are a good example of how a genre can emerge from a single game and grow.</p>
			<p><em>Rogue</em> was developed in 1980 by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  The game was inspired by early text-based adventure games and interactive fiction.  In order to create a multitude of experiences from one very small code base, a library for random generation developed by Ken Arnold was used to create random levels in the game.</p>
			<p><em>Rogue</em> is defined by procedural generation of levels, simple graphics, text interactions, turn-based play and permanent character death.  These characteristics have grown to form a popular sub-genre, called "roguelike".</p>
			<p><em>Rogue</em> inspired an entire movement, and many other games were inspired by it's basic design.  Today there are <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="blank">communinities</a> dedicated to roguelike game develoment and many indie games are created combining new platforms with roguelike characteristics.</p>

		literary genres
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_genre
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_genres
		The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy,[1] comedy, and creative nonfiction.[citation needed] They can all be in the form of prose or poetry. Additionally, a genre such as satire, allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre (see below), but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed.
