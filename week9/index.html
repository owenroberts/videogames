			<h1>Emergence and progression</h1>
			<p><a href="../index.html">Video Games</a></p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<p>Emergence and progression are two aspects of creating systems for gameplay.  Emergence refers to the creation of very simple rules with open ended results.  Progression is an order of predefined challenges.  Most video games use both of these concepts in their design.  Some games favor emergent models and other favor progressive models.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Emergence</h2>
			<p>Examples of emergence can be fond in games like chess or <i>The Sims</i>.</p>
			<p>Game of emergence will have a strategy guide rather than a walkthrough.  In these games, simple rules lead to complex systems.  Each gameplay will be different from previous games.  Designers of emergent games study the effects of small changes to the structure of rules in the overall gameplay.</p>
			enhanced by multiplayer, or sophisticated ai
			positive and negative feedback
			the game design accounts for likely results and defines "winning"
			rubber-banding - mario kart, weapons shooting cars in front
			internal economy
			goals formed by individual players rather than being set by designers
			can be short, hard to have longer versions, except for things like civilization
			hard to learn
			esports and dota
			emergence, whole must be greater than sum of its parts
			desirable and undesirable emergence

		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Progression</h2>
			<p>Examples of progressive games include <i>Super Mario</i> and <i>King's Quest.</i></p>
			levels control the players progression through a game
			the fiction of the game world is enhanced by progression
			the game space - games structured spatially rather than temporarily
			progression games are reliant on video game platform distribution, lots of assets and predefined levels and actions
			walkthroughs explain everything that happens throughout the game
			usually single player, one playthrough usually normal
			usually longer
			easier to learn
		</div>

		<div class="slide">
			<h2>Using emergence and progression</h2>
			progression done well allows game designers to introduce complex systems in ways that the player can understand
			progress as a resource
			balance between freedom and limitation, want player to be able to do whatever they want, but lose track of story
